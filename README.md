# **Notes for Watson / HouseSitting**
Thanks for taking care of Watson!

## **Watson**
### **Walks**
#### Schedule
Watson gets walks 3 times a day.
**Time ranges are:**
6AM-8AM, 11PM - 1PM, and 7:30PM - 9:30PM

Some deviations from this schedule are fine.

 
#### Walking Tips

Watson understands:
1. Sit (and/or a raised fist)
2. Wait - If you need him to stop walking
3. Let's go - for when you need him to stop getting distracted
4. No - If he's eating a lot of grass (if he eat's too much grass he has digestion issues)
5. Yes - This indicates that he did something good and gets a treat. Say "yes" and give him a treat (he is VERY responsive to the word "yes").

We've been working on not letting him walk forward if he's tugging.

If he's tugging forward, stop and say "come back" and he will come back next to you (he might need a light tug back as well). If he's being very stubborn or pulling too often, please feel free to use the small water spray bottle (next to his leash on the shoe rack) to spritz him a few times and say "No." We are using this to discourage unwanted behavior, and he usually responds well to it.

He's trained to always walk on the left side.

He gets along with some dogs, but not others, so I would avoid other dogs to be on the safe side.

### Food
Watson eats around 7AM and 6PM.

Watson's food is in the cabinet next to the balcony door. You can give him ~2.5 scoops of kibble (the measuring cup is inside of the kibble bag).

### Toys
We left some of his toys on the couch. He sometimes kicks them under the TV stand.
He really likes Benebones, I'll have a fresh one that you can give him when his old one is worn out.

## **House**
### Keys
There is a lockbox out front in the mailbox with the house key. The code is 3528.

### Deliveries
Please bring in mail from the mailbox and place it inside on the kitchen table.

### Things to do while you're here
Please make yourself at home and enjoy yourself!

The wi-fi network is 
`OnePingToRuleThemAll` 
and the password is

Feel free to use music equipment, TV, etc.
The TV is just a FireTV, the remote is on the stand next to the couch.

The heater isn't 100% functional. It needs to be manually triggered.
